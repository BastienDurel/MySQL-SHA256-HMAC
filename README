The file HMACSHA1.sql contains code to compute a hashed message authentication code using the SHA-1 hash.

To import this function into an existing MySQL schema use the following at the command line:

mysql -u<user> -D<database> < HMACSHA1.sql

where <user> has the appropriate permissions on the <database> schema.
